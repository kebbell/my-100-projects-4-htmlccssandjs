        The defining characteristics of Glassmorphism are objects with a semi-transparent background, background blur and a subtle light border. Blend all that together in the right way and you have yourself some premium looking glass.

        Glassmorphism is a popular User Interface (UI) design trend characterized by a frosted glass effect, where backgrounds are blurred behind semi-transparent panels. This style mimics the look of glass and creates a sense of depth and dimensionality while maintaining a sleek, modern aesthetic.
